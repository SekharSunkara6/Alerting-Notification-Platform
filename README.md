# Alerting & Notification Platform

## Project Overview

This project is a scalable, extensible backend system for managing alerts and notifications within an organization. It enables administrators to create, configure, and manage alerts based on organizational, team, or user-level visibility. End Users receive alerts via an in-app delivery system with recurring reminders every 2 hours until snoozed or expired.

The system ensures timely communication, user control over notifications, and analytical insights into alert usage and engagement.

***

## Features Summary

### Admin Capabilities

- Create, update, and archive alerts with flexible visibility settings
- Alert details: title, message, severity (Info, Warning, Critical)
- Delivery type: MVP supports In-App notifications (extensible to Email/SMS)
- Reminder frequency: default 2 hours reminder until snoozed or expiry
- Alert visibility: whole org, selected teams, or selected users
- Analytics on alerts: view total created, read rates, snoozes, severity breakdown

### User Capabilities

- Receive alerts relevant to their organization/team/user assignment
- Alerts auto re-trigger every 2 hours till user snoozes or alert expires
- Snooze an alert for current day; reset snooze next day automatically
- Mark alerts as read/unread
- View history of snoozed and active alerts

### Shared & Backend Features

- Alerts visible based on effective visibility calculating org/team/user membership
- Notification delivery logging with user preferences for snooze and read states
- Analytics endpoint providing alert metrics for system-wide monitoring
- Modular, clean OOP design with extensibility for new notification channels and reminder frequencies

***

## Tech Stack

- Node.js with Express framework
- TypeScript for type safety and OOP principles

## Core Data Models

| Model                 | Description                                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alert                 | Represents alerts with details such as title, message, severity, reminder frequency, visibility, and scheduling. |
| User                  | Holds user details including ID, name, and team association.    |
| Team                  | Represents organizational teams with unique IDs and names.     |
| UserAlertPreference   | Tracks per-user per-alert states: read/unread and snoozed until.|
| NotificationDelivery  | Logs each alert delivery to a user for analytics and debugging. |

  "expiryTime": "2025-09-25T00:00:00.000Z",
  "visibleToOrg": true,
  "reminderFrequencyMinutes": 120,
  "enableReminders": true
}
```

***

While this MVP satisfies all assignment requirements, the code is designed for easy extension to include:

- Email and SMS delivery channels via Strategy Pattern
- Custom reminder frequencies beyond 2 hours
- Scheduled alerts running on cron or specific times of day
- Escalation logic for unacknowledged alerts
- Role-based access control for secure admin operations
- Push notification service integration
- Persistent database support
- Frontend dashboard for admins and users

***

## Notes & Known Limitations

- In-memory data storage limits persistence (loses data on server restart)
- User authentication simulated using headers for demo purposes
- Timezone consistency maintained with UTC datetime handling
- Manual API endpoint for reminder triggering simulates real scheduling
